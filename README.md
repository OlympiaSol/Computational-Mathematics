# Project 2021 B: Wheeled Robot Motion Simulation

## Overview
This GitHub repository hosts the project for MYU504 - Computational Mathematics at the University of Ioannina, focused on simulating the motion of a wheeled robot. The project involves modeling the robot's movement using differential equations and implementing numerical methods for their solution.

## Features
- Implementation of Euler and Modified Euler methods for solving differential equations.
- Analysis of the wheeled robot's kinematics, including linear and angular velocities.
- Graphical visualization of the robot's trajectory and speed over time.

## Requirements
- MATLAB or GNU Octave environment.
- Basic understanding of differential equations and numerical methods.
